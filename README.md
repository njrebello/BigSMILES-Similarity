# Polymer Automata Fingerprinting for Machine Learning and Structural Similarity

# Organization
The file Similarity-Validation contains three spreadsheets:
  - Equivalent presents case studies of whether a set of BigSMILES that represents the same molecular ensemble have the same similarity score of 1.
  - Same topology presents case studies of a query against a set of targets within the same topology.
  - Across topology presents case studies of a query against a set of targets across topologies.
